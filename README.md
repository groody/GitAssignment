# GitAssignment
 **THIS ASSIGNMENT IS INTENDED TO BE DONE WITH A PARTNER**
Hello friendos! This is our assignment to introduce the wonders of git to you. 

In this repository, we have three text files. In Chapter_1.txt, we provide an introduction to a story that should take readers though the journey of their lifetime. Now it is up to you and your pair programmer to finish this story!

For this assignment, fork this repository to one of your GitHub accounts. Then, clone the repository to your computer, and add your story to chapter_2.txt. Next push your new story. Have the other person then clone the repository to their computer, and have them add their story to chapter_3.txt. Finally, have them push the story to the repository and bask in the warm feeling of finishing such an amazing story.
