Prologue:

Two dorm, both alike in dignity, 
In fair Harvey Mudd, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth the fatal loins of these two dorms
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their grade
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their ITR bury dorm strife
The fearful passage of their fail-mark'd love,
And the continuance of their parent's rage,
Which, but their children's fail, nought could remove,
Is now the traffic of our internet
The which if you with patient fingers type,
What here shall miss, your toil shall strive to mend


Scene 1: Shanahan. A public place.
    (Enter Sam and Greg, of the dorm of Case, armed with smartphone and Stairbucks)
Sam:
  Greg, o' my word, we can't let them humiliate us. We won't take their trash talk.
  
Greg:
  (teasing Sam) Nah, because then we'd be garbagemen.
  
Sam:
  What I mean is, if they make us angry, we'll pull out our Pokemon Go and show them our 96% IV Pokemon.
  
Greg:
  Maybe you should focus on avoiding conflict, Sam.
  
Sam:
  I square up fast when I'm angry
  
Greg:
  But it's difficult to make you angry
  
Sam:
  One of these dogs from the Sontag dorm can make me angry.
  
Greg:
  Angry enough to run away. You won't stanbd and fight.
  
Sam:
  A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand. If I pass one of them on the street, I'll take a side closer to the wall and let him walk in the gutter.
  
Greg:
  That means you're the weak one, because weaklings get pushed up against the wall.
  
Sam:
  You're right. So what I'll do is push the Sontag men onto the floor.
  
Greg:
  The fight is between our upperclassmen, and we people who do their work.

Sam:
  It's all the same. I'll be a mean person to them. After I confront the upperclassmen, I'll be nice to their underclassmen - I'll prank them.

Greg:
  Prank them? You mean coax them into a snafu?

Sam:
  Whatever, take my words in whichever sense you like.
  
Greg:
  The people around you are the ones who'll have to sense it.

Sam:
  They'll sense me as long as I can be around. Everybody knows I'm a piece of trash.
  
Greg:
  It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish. You're a dried and shriveled like salted fish.

  (Abram and another person of Sontag enter.)
  Pull out your Pokemon.
  
Sam:
  I have my Diglet ready. I'll back you up.
  
Greg:
  How will you back me up? By running away? 
  
Sam:
  Don't worry about me/
  
Greg:
  No, really. I am worried about you.

Sam:
  Let's not confront them. I mean, we can't even battle them in Pokemon Go.
  
Greg:
  I'll sneer at them as they pass by, and their defence and special defence will be lowered.
  
Sam:
  You mean they'll think you're weird. I'll bite my thumb at them. That's an insult, and if they let me get away with it they'll be dishonored. (Sam bites his thumb)
  
Abram:
  Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
